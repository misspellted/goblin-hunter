# Goblin Hunter

## Overview

This game is based on the pygame-tutorial video series from Tech with Tim,
although turning the pages of history is the only way to identify that origin
of the source, due to significant changes in the code to make it more object
oriented.

## Objective

Hunt and kill all the goblins on screen. The game ends a bit abruptly, after
all goblins are dead.

## Controls

Controls are currently limited:
* Up: Jump
* Left: Move left
* Right: Move right
* Space: Shoot weapon
